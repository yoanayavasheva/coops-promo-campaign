      <h2>Have you heard of worker co-operatives?</h2>
      <p>
        The International Cooperative Alliance (ICA) defines a co-operative as
        <strong
          ><em
            >"an autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet
            their common economic, social and cultural needs and aspirations
            through a jointly-owned and democratically-controlled
            enterprise."</em
          ></strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        A co-operative is an alternative business ownership model that favors
        member welfare and sustainable production amongst other values. In a
        co-op the members are also the owners of the business. The key feature
        of one-member-one-vote creates a distinctly flat structure within
        between members.

            <strong>Q: How do I prepare for an interview at a co-op?</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            Prepare for a co-op interview by reflecting on how your skills and
            previous experience will apply to the position. Familiarize yourself
            with the co-op principles and think a little about why working at a
            co-op is desirable for you.
